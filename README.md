# yExtension

Why? I couldn't come with a better idea for a name xD

This extension is made for [Siege](https://siege.hackclub.com), [Hackclub](https://hackclub.com/)'s ysws
In summary: This whole extension is basically a shitpost

WARNING: CONTAINS IMAGE OF A J\*B APPLICATION!!!!

What it can do:

- randomly flashbang u when u click something
- make buttons dissapear for a second
- replace images to "spooky" ones

Very long demo (when i click on buttons it is to trigger a jumpscare cuz it takes a 1/10 chance)

### Little Journal

Note: all contents of the journal were human made (me)

- Hour 1-3: developed code for detecting clicks (so `<a>` and `<button>`) and play a sound func that relies on Audio Context (i think) and an oscilator
- Hour 4: Made a export function (for the beeps) that can be used in other places to play beeps easily. Also playing with localstorage
- Hour 5 or 6? idk. well i added basic jumpscares. the first one is a test and the second one is the flashbang from cs. I need to do more things and i need to add more jumpscares and i need to imporve the extension :sob:
